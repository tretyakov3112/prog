Группировка данных позволяет объединить одинаковые значения в заданных полях в группы, а затем выполнять подсчеты для каждой группы. Если в результате выполнения запроса не получено ни одной строки (или ни одной строки для данной группы), то исходные данные для вычисления любой из агрегатных функций отсутствуют. В этом случае результатом выполнения функций COUNT будет нуль, а результатом всех других функций — NULL.\n","\n","Агрегатные функции **MIN** и **MAX** вычисляют наименьшее и наибольшее значение столбца соответственно. Аргументами могут быть числа, строки и даты. Все значения NULL удаляются перед вычислением (т.е. в расчет не берутся).\n","\n","Агрегатная функция **SUM** вычисляет общую сумму значений столбца. Аргументами могут быть только числа. Использование параметра DISTINCT устраняет все повторяющиеся значения в столбце перед применением функции SUM. Аналогично удаляются все значения NULL перед применением этой агрегатной функции.\n","\n","Агрегатная функция **AVG** возвращает среднее значение для всех значений столбца. Аргументами также могут быть только числа, а все значения NULL удаляются перед вычислением.\n","\n","Агрегатная функция **COUNT** имеет две разные формы:\n","\n","**COUNT([DISTINCT] col_name)** — подсчитывает количество значений в столбце col_name, значения NULL не учитываются\n","\n","**COUNT(*)** — подсчитывает количество строк в таблице, значения NULL также учитываются\n","\n","\n","Для GROUP BY все значения NULL трактуются как равные, т.е. при группировке по полю, содержащему NULL-значения, все такие строки попадут в одну группу.\n","\n","Чтобы присвоить столбцу псевдоним, нужно после его определения записать AS и указать желаемое имя. Оно должно начинаться с буквы и не должно содержать пробелов."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"2729ca17","metadata":{"id":"2729ca17","outputId":"9fabac5d-3dc7-4eb3-fa5e-1e7c7f6b69ba"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>CGPA</th>\n","      <th>South_Asia_stud_num</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>2.0 -
